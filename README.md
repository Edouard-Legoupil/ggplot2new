## Welcome to `Learn ggplot2` Shiny App!

Hello ! My name is Keon-Woong Moon. I am a Professor of Cardiology at Catholic University of Korea, South Korea. It's an honor and pleasure to introduce you my shiny app-`Learn ggplots`.


## What this app aims

This app is for reseachers, students or professors who want to learn how to make a plot with ggplot2. With this app, you can make your plot `step by step` without coding. You can obtain beautiful plots in png or pdf format. You can also download the powerpoint file with or without r code by `just one click`.

## What you need for this app

All you need for this app is a modern web browser supporting HTML5(chrome, opera, safari and ...). `No R installation` is required. `No LaTex` installation is required. This app is independent of operating system of your computer. Windows, Mac and Linux PCs are all compatible. You can use even `a tablet PC` or `a smartphone`.

Thanks to Hadley Wickham who developed R package [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html). Thanks to Winston Chang who wrote the book [`R graphics cookbook`](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do) and developed R package [`gcookbook`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcookbook/index.html). I was inspired by his book. For Koreans I strongly recommend my book "web-based anlaysis with R".
